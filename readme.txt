Enables users to search for posts containing multiple tags.

== Description ==

This plugin creates an interface for users to search a site's tags. Users can select multiple tags and wether the results should have "all" or merely "any" of the tags.
This functionality requires JavaScript to be enabled. Users without JavaScript enabled will experience simple links to the tag archive pages.
This plugin includes a copy of [TDO Tag Fixes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tdo-tag-fixes/) to enable tag intersections.

== Installation ==

To install this plugin:

1. Install and activate the plugin, in the normal way;


== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
